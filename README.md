# AICTE-Internship-Potato-Leaf-Disease
**Potato Leaf Disease Prediction ðŸŒ±ðŸ”¬**
**Overview**
This project uses deep learning (CNN) to detect potato leaf diseases such as Early Blight and Late Blight. It helps farmers identify diseases early, reducing crop losses.

**Features**
âœ… Detects Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy Leaves
âœ… Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high accuracy
âœ… Web-based application for real-time disease prediction
âœ… Helps promote sustainable farming by reducing pesticide overuse

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of potato leaf images categorized as Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight.

**Usage**
Upload a potato leaf image.
The model will classify it as Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight.
Based on the result, take necessary actions for crop protection.

**Future Improvements**
Expand dataset for more diseases
Improve accuracy with Transfer Learning
Develop a mobile app for easier access
